# Obesity-Classification-using-Ensemble
Here, In a obesity dataset, the ensemble technique is applied to classify the type of obesity. At first, Logistics Regression, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree algorithms are combined. The Ensemble model accuracy is 0.90 whether first 3 model's accuracy are respectively 0.66,0.64,0.94. So,the result is not as expexted. Then, Logistics Regression, KNN and Decision Tree algorithms are combined. The Ensemble model accuracy is 0.93 whether first 3 model's accuracy are respectively 0.66,0.89,0.94. So,this result is also not as expexted. After that, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree algorithms are combined. The Ensemble model accuracy is 0.96 whether first 3 model's accuracy are respectively 0.95,0.89,0.94. So,At last, the optimum result comes out. We got the best accuracy. Here, in the first two trial, soft ensemble technique is used. But in the last trial, to get the optimum result ensemble technique is changed to the hard technique. Here, We also used the advanced ensemble techniques that is stacking. In this stacking technique, the accuracy we got is 0.94, though it is less than before hard/soft ensemble technique.I think we can improve this accuracy by using different classifier or by doing data-pre-processing cautiously etc.
